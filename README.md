# ExpressionEngine Plugin Boostrap

Fork or copy this repo to get started on a new ExpressionEngine plugin.

Then:

1. Rename the bootstrap directory and contained files to the appropriate plugin name.
2. Fill in the correct values in the (renamed) pi.bootstrap.php and bootstrap_model.php files. Take care to change the class names but observe the correct cases and underscores.
3. Update the values in chnagelog.md, package.json, and this readme.md file.
